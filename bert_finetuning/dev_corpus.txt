I was in otel for ITB fair.
Hotel seems like from 70's.
Every where needs to be renovation.
No service after 08.
00 PM.
First night I asked to take one extra pillow, receptionist said that it's not possible because there is no any duty employee except receptionist.
All carpets are dirty.
All mobels are very old.
There is a old style TV but there is no remote control.
I didn't understand how german autorities doesn't make an inspection.

Definitely a good choice - the double room was absolutely huge and the bed was really comfortable.
The hotel is located close to the underground transport system and the location is perfect for easy access to other parts of this wonderful city.
I did not eat breakfast here so I can't comment on the food but the staff were helpful enough (if a little cold) and the hotel amenities were perfect for what we wanted on this sightseeing city break - a clean, spacious rom with a comfortable bed and a hot shower in a suitable location.
Will definitely stay here again when I return to Berlin.

From checkin to checkout this hotel exceeded our expectations.
The location was perfest, the room was perfect, the breakfast was perfect, the staff were good.
The rate included breakfast and the breakfast had it all: eggs, both scrambled and hard boiled, bacon, fruit, cereal, good coffee etc.
The underground train was 100 meters from the door and you can go anywhere in Berlin with it.
The Hard Rock was across the street and there were resaurants everywhere.
We aren't great shoppers but there were stores everywhere to take your money.
We took a hop on hop off tour and found it worthwhile.
The checkpoint charlie museum highlited the desperation of that era.
For the price we paid 55 euro a nite it was a special 4 star hotel.

Pleasant stay, spacious warm rooms.
decor very dated but priced appropriately.
Nice staff, fab breakfast €10 not too bad a price.

It is not a 4 star hotel.
Rooms were old but on the bright side ok sized and clean.
Great location and nice staff at the reception with warm and welcomming smiles:-) breakfast so-so.
Transport within very easy access.
Hard rock cafe on the opposite side of the hotel.
For lunch go to KaDeWe department store for their lovely food court:-).

We've been there for six days and the location and everything was ok in my room; however, this was not the case with the other party's room, where hymidity was holding a party! Seemed like a former communist house turned into a youth hostel and not a 4 star hotel.
There are two underground stations nearby, within walking distance, which is truly helpful but consider staying in another hotel if a renovation doesn't take place immediately! The banquet breakfast was fantastic and tasty (besides the tomatoes) and the personnel were helpful, friendly and smiling and gave you a sense of safety - a big plus - they even allowed us an earlier check in a later check out - which was greatly appreciated.
They even kept an eye on our luggages on our departure day which was of a great help.
Furthermore, they handed free copies of Berlin maps and overall they were quite polite.
I mean everybody.
The building, on the other hand, is quite old, with a steady smell of old carpets and quite a few stains on it as well! I would recommend the hotel for its location - especially if you are planning to be in the city most of the day, or if you travel alone but not suggested if you are planning a romantic getaway!.

This hotel is in a super convenient location with airport bus just outside and excellent bus, U-bahn and S-bahn connections within a minute or two from the hotel.
I believe the hotel is undergoing a much needed face-lift, if the standard of our room is anything to go by.
Ancient, grotty wardrobe and tired old bathroom.
Light years away from a 4-star standard.
Other rooms we happened to catch a glance of seemed more modern.
No internet connection in the room, only wireless network available in the lobby for 5 Euro a day.
Not impressed.
The breakfast however was sensational and the staff very friendly and helpful.
In short: Great location, excellent breakfast, friendly staff, disappointing room.

This hotel at very good location, for a good price.
You don't even need to walk and there's lots of shops, cafes, restaurants, transport etc.
The room was fairly spacious for a solo traveller, well designed, and the bed particularly comfortable.
My room was on the front of the hotel and I had a lovely view of the main street.
The breakfast was a typical continental breakfast but was of good quality.
No air conditioning, very hot rooms.
Unable to open windows due to traffic noise.
Hotel neded a renovation.

The hotel has an excellent location, the staff are friendly and helpful.
The breakfasts are very good with lots of choice.
The rooms and corridors, however, are shabby and years overdue for refurbishment.
It is definitely not 4* standard, if the hotel is not careful it could get done if it continues to claim 4* status.

The hotel looks awaful inside.
It looks like a communistic hotel from the 80'.
In many places you can notice that it has not been renovated for a long time However the hotel is located in the center of Berlin with easy subway access.

Four nights here over a party weekend in Berlin.
It was a little away from the action (my travel companion had booked it) but close to the U-Bahn and walkable to everything we needed.
The breakfast was quite nice but had its irritations too (the urn for hot water was always empty, and indicating the fact to staff didn't seem to help with getting it topped up - I ended up filling it myself from the bottled water on the buffet).
No internet access in the rooms - you have to pay for it and to go downstairs to the lobby area.
The hotel is tired and in need of a refurb (it has a metal key of the last-century variety - not ideal when you have two people sharing but coming and going independently).
The plumbing seemed to clog up and the room had poor ventilation and seeming had heating stuck on (it wasn't that hot in Berlin but the room seemed very warm).
I wouldn't have picked this place, and found it more than a little disappointing.

The hotel was very nice, I loved the arquitecture and the receptionists were very nice.
However, they did not disclose the fact that there was no internet access in the rooms (only in public areas and for a cost of 5 additional euros a day).
Also, the room I got was soooo far away in the back, I got two single separated beds and the room had back/low view so I could hear every time someone was going to the parking lot or when the train (S-bahn Zoo) passed (basically every 6 minutes).
Besides that, it's pretty well located, surrounded by shops and restaurants and really close access to the U-bahn and S-bahn.
Very nice walks.
Also, it has great room service and a lovely mini-bar.

the hotel is well located, easy to access for disabled people, clean and comfortable.
I found the staff polite friendly and helpful.
The breakfast was very good and I've never before seen such a selection of breads.
Our room was a good size the windows opened easily and the electrically operated blind was a bonus.
We will certainly book again next time we visit Berlin.
Special thanks to the young man on late duty on reception for his restaurant recommendation, we had a really good anniversary meal.

We stayed here for three nights.
The hotel's location is good, which is why we choose to stay here.
That was a mistake.
The staff were chilly, arrogant and unhelpful; our room was in poor/bad condition (e.
g.
our heavy bathroom door was right off its hinges and it took a whole day to fix this; the shower drain was blocked; there was no soap; and so on).
Moreover, the hotel itself was not clean (e.
g.
the carpets on main stair were dirty and were not hoovered for the three days we were there); the bar/lounge is poorly run and disorganized; etc.
This hotel should be avoided.
It is poorly managed and poorly maintained.
It is noticeably inferior to similarly priced hotels throughout Europe and our experience here took away from the enjoyment and pleasure of our visit to Berlin.

Back from a week in Berlin staying at the hotel AM Zoo Berlin, having read all the reviews I sort of knew what to expect, the hotel could do with having air conditioning in the rooms and the rooms are slightly old fashioned but didn't mind this, we had to change rooms from room 506 to 507 as 506 had one of the beds broken (the slats that hold the mattress on half of the were completely broken) surprised the mattress managed to stay up.
Breakfast excellent wide variety of cereals, cakes, cooked food delicious.
The hotel is on the main shopping street Kurfurstendamm, right opposite the hard rock cafe and if you are making your own way from the airport the X109 goes straight there and stops right opposite.
The hotel is just around the corner from the local supermarket ullrich and round the corner from the zoo where the local 200 and 100 buses go around all the main tourist attractions would stay here again and recommend to anyone visiting berlin.

My son and I stayed here for six days at the end of June.
While the hotel is in a great location, the room is clean and the staff is friendly, I would not stay here again.
First, the room is very hot.
We could not open our window and the door to the outside would only open about two inches at the top.
It was completely unbearable during the day and uncomfortable at best during the night.
If the heat wasn't enough, the noise level from the street was high.
Hard Rock Cafe is right across the street and we found it didn't get quiet until 2 or 3 in the morning on most nights.
Third, the internet only works on the first two floors and it doesn't work consistently.
So you may pay the high price for it and it may or may not work.

The hotel seemed nice at first glance, trendy lobby and perfectly located smack dab on Kurfürstendamm, 50 meters from the closes tube stop.
Breakfast was pretty good, eggs and bacon every day and some other stuff that was switched around from day to day so you didn't get tired of the food.
One thing that was extremely annoying was that the juice glasses were one deciliter in size! This means that you have to go back and forth like 5-6 times to fill up your glass during breakfast.
Alternatively just fill up and bring a whole lot of glasses to your table.
It was difficult to sleep at the hotel because it was so incredibly hot.
I can only imagine how it is in July!!! We slept with the windows as open as possible, but we couldn't open them much due to the blind we had to pull down to keep the light out.
So the air was no circulation, completely dead and 900 degrees in the room.
Had they installed air condition in the rooms, this would have been a great hotel, but sleeping is the most important this in a hotel and when you can't get a good nights sleep, I can't recommend it.
